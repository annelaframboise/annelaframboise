    My hobbies include canning preserves I've made, baking, embroidery, sewing, gardening, 
    and refinishing furniture. I'm currently working on several projects including:
    <ul>
      <li>Making and canning cara cara orange marmalade </li>
      <li>Embroidering a wreath made of raspberries and raspberry blossoms</li>
      <li>Sewing a pair of plaid pants</li>
      <li>Growing ground cherry seedlings in my kitchen for transplanting to the garden</li>
      <li>Redesigning and refinishing an antique sewing table for use with a modern machine</li>
    </ul> 
    I also enjoy data visualization and other activities related to data science.
